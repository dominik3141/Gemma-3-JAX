We will be using our nice prefill optimized forward function to do some supervised
finetraining of Gemma.

Plan:
1.  Take sequence from training data
2.  Encode to tokens
3.  Calculate loss
    - Simple forward on input tokens
    - Loss defined as | x_n - x_{n-1} | with an appropriate norm
4.  Take \nabla loss
5.  Adjust parameters (let's start with SGD)

We might have to adjust our forward function to also take a mask so that we can
properly deal with batches of different input lengths.
But for now we just always take sequences of the same length to avoid this problem.
